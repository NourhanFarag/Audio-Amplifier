# Audio Amplifier Project

This repository contains the design, development, and testing of a low voltage audio power amplifier. The project was completed as part of the Electronic Circuits 1 course (CCE204) at [Your University].

## Abstract

The aim of this project was to design and develop an audio power amplifier for CD and DVD players. The project involves studying amplifier circuits, constructing the amplifier, and performing various tests to evaluate its performance.

## Introduction

An amplifier increases the voltage, current, or power of a signal and is used in various audio equipment. This project focuses on building a basic audio amplifier using the LM386 IC.

## Components

- **IC LM386**
- **IC Socket**
- **Battery 9V**
- **Capacitors**: 0.1uF, 47nF, 220uF, 10uF, 100uF
- **Resistors**: 10 ohm, 1.2k ohm
- **Potentiometer**: 10k ohm
- **Audio input jack**
- **Speaker**: 8-ohm 0.5 watt
- **Project box**

## Circuit Design

The amplifier circuit was designed using the LM386 IC. Capacitors were used to reduce noise, resistors to manage voltage and current, and a potentiometer to adjust volume. The project included PCB layout and manufacturing.

## Results

The amplifier successfully reproduced audio signals with desired volume and power levels, though with some noise and lower output levels.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrated the design and construction of a low voltage audio amplifier, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

### Installation

1. Solder the components onto a PCB according to the circuit diagram.
2. Connect the audio input jack and speaker.
3. Power the circuit with a 9V battery.

### Usage

1. Plug in an audio source to the input jack.
2. Adjust the volume using the potentiometer.
3. Listen to the amplified audio through the speaker.
